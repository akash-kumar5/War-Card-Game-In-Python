# War-Card-Game-In-Python

War Card Game in Python
This is a Python implementation of the classic card game, War. The objective of the game is to win all the cards.

In this implementation, two players will play against each other using a standard deck of 52 cards. The game begins with the deck of cards being shuffled and divided evenly between the two players. Each player will then draw a card from their deck and place it face up on the table. The player with the highest card wins the round and adds both cards to the bottom of their deck. If the cards drawn by both players are of the same rank, a "war" is declared and each player will draw three more cards and place the fourth card face up. The player with the highest fourth card wins the round and adds all the cards to the bottom of their deck. The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

The game is built using Python programming language, and utilizes classes, functions, and conditional statements to keep track of the deck and cards, and to check for a winner. It includes user prompts and input validation to ensure smooth gameplay.

# Requirements
This implementation requires Python 3 to be installed on the system.

# How to Play
To start playing the game, simply run the war.py file in your terminal:

# Copy code
python war.py
You will be prompted to enter the names of the two players. The game will then begin, and the current state of the game will be displayed, including the number of cards in each player's deck.

Players will take turns drawing a card from their deck and placing it face up on the table. If a "war" is declared, each player will draw three more cards and place the fourth card face up. The player with the highest card wins the round and adds all the cards to the bottom of their deck. The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

# Additional Features
In addition to the basic gameplay, this implementation includes the following features:

Track and display the current round number
Option to play multiple rounds or until one player wins all the cards
Input validation to prevent invalid entries

# Acknowledgements
This implementation was built using Python and inspiration was taken from other War card games available online.
